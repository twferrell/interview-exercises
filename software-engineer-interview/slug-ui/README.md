# Slug UI
This is a simple React web app which exposes a simple UI for creating a new slug entity.

To avoid CORS issues, I have the browser proxy through the dev server here over to the APIs.

By default, this app will run on localhost, port 3000 and the APIs are setup currently to run on localhost, port 8080.

## Steps

Start the API server and then run: 

### `yarn install`

This will install the dependencies.

### `yarn run serve`

This will start the local dev server.
